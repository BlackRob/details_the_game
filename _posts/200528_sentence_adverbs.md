Recently, when talking with a student, I was asked what the difference 
was between "He clearly did it" and "Clearly, he did it". I have to admit 
that I found it difficult to give a good answer, because I'd never 
had to explain it before. There definitely is a difference; as a native speaker 
I'd sometimes use one, and sometimes the other, but why?

So I did what any good teacher would do: I told the student I'd have to look it up. 
__It's okay to not know everything.__ Now that I've looked it up, this is how I would 
explain the difference. 

In the first sentence, "clearly" is a normal adverb. 
It modifies the verb "did" and answers the question, how / in what manner? 

He did it. _How did he do it?_ He __clearly__ did it [i.e. it's easy to see that he did it]

In the second case, __clearly__ acts on the whole sentence. It expresses the speaker's 
feelings about it. When adverbs are used this way they're called "sentence adverbs".
Sentence adverbs are similar to interjections in how they reflect the speaker's attitude.

Imagine this situation: you and I are trying to solve a mystery. Today is Karen's 
birthday. We bought her a cake, but someone ate the entire thing! We decide to look 
at the social media accounts of all the suspects, and one of them, Tom, 
just posted a picture of himself with frosting all over his face and the hashtag 
_#CakeBandit_. When you see this you might say:

<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Clearly</span>, <span class="sPron">he</span> <span class="sVerb">did</span> <span class="sPron">it</span>.</p>

Here, __clearly__ means "it's obviously true; anyone who saw this picture would agree". 
Or you might say,

<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Wow</span>! <span class="sPron">He</span> <span class="sVerb">did</span> <span class="sPron">it</span>.</p>

The interjection __wow__ shows that you're suprised --maybe before 
you saw the picture you thought someone else ate the cake. 

To repeat: __sentence adverbs, like interjections, show the speaker's feelings 
about the sentence__. Like interjections, they're not necessary, but people use 
them all the time. Here are several commonly used sentence adverbs:

__Obviously__ means almost the same thing as clearly: that anyone can see something is true.

<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Obviously</span>, <span class="sPron">we</span> <span class="sVerb">have to buy</span> <span class="sAdj">another</span> <span class="sNoun">cake</span>.</p>

__Frankly__ means "what I am about to say it true".

<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Frankly</span>, <span class="sPron">I</span> <span class="sAdv">never</span> <span class="sVerb">trusted</span> <span class="sPron">him</span>.</p>

__Hopefully__ means "I hope what I am about to say will happen".

<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Hopefully</span>, <span class="sPron">he</span> <span class="sVerb">can get</span> <span class="sNoun">treatment</span> <span class="sPrep">for</span> <span class="sAdj">his</span> <span class="sNoun">cake addiction</span>.</p>

Other sentence adverbs include __plainly__, __honestly__, __luckily__ and __surprisingly__. 
If you are not sure how to use them, remember: __A__lways __C__heck __T__he __D__ictionary!
