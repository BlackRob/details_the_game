One of the first things a student learns is how to turn a statement
into a question. The simplest form is to put "do" or "does" at the beginning
of the sentence, which turns it into a yes/no question.<sup>1</sup>

<p class="example"><span class="sPron">Tom</span> <span class="sVerb">likes</span> <span class="sNoun">cats</span>.</p>
<p class="example"><span class="sVerb">Does</span> <span class="sPron">Tom</span> <span class="sVerb">like</span> <span class="sNoun">dogs</span>?</p>
<p class="example"><span class="sAdv">Yes</span>, <span class="sPron">Tom</span> <span class="sVerb">likes</span> <span class="sNoun">dogs</span>.</p>

Not all questions can be answered with "yes" or "no", so there is another way to form questions,
by starting with a question word, like "who", "what" or "when", then following it with a
helping verb in the proper tense, then the subject, then the main verb and other words.
There's a name for this: _subject-auxiliary inversion_. Which just means that you take
the subject of the sentence, and the auxiliary (another name for helping verbs) and _invert_
them (make them switch places). If the sentence doesn't have an auxiliary verb, use a form
of "do". An example:

<p class="example"><span class="sPron">What</span> <span class="sVerb">has</span> <span class="sPron">she</span> <span class="sVerb">eaten</span>?</p>
<p class="example"><span class="sPron">She</span> <span class="sVerb">has eaten</span> <span class="sNoun">tacos</span>.</p>

The pattern is pretty simple, but in practice it can get confusing, because there are
a lot of different question words, and several different helping verbs, with different
forms, and different subjects can only go with certain forms of the verb. To help you
practice choosing the right form, your friends at Grumbly Games have made a question
wheel. Press the buttons around the outside of the wheel to turn the rings and line up
the words to start a question.

<figure style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; margin: 20px 0px 40px 0px; display: flex; flex-flow: column;"> 
<iframe style="position: absolute; display: block; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 1px solid black; box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px var(--headerbg);" src="/questionwheel" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<figcaption style="position: absolute; width: 100%; bottom: -35px; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;">
<a href="/questionwheel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">click here to open in a new tab</a></figcaption>
</figure>

When you use the wheel, the thing to keep in mind is that this only starts a question.
You almost always need at least a main verb to complete the question. So, if I spin
the wheels and choose, "What", "have" and "you", I still need to add another verb
before I have a meaningful question:

<p class="example"><span class="sPron">What</span> <span class="sVerb">have</span> <span class="sPron">you</span> <span class="sVerb">eaten</span>?</p>
<p class="example"><span class="sPron">I</span> <span class="sVerb">have eaten</span> <span class="sAdj">six</span> <span class="sNoun">apples</span>.</p>

The wheel has colored outlines around some verb forms and the same colors around
the pronouns on the inner wheel to indicate which forms and pronouns can be
used together. You should also remember that certain helping verbs have to have
the correct verb forms following them.

- **have, has and had** are always followed by
  the past participle (third form) of a main verb to form
  the _present perfect_ and _past perfect_: **I have eaten**
- **do, does and did** are always followed by
  the root form of a main verb: **I do eat**; the helping verb "do"
  is needed to form questions, but is not needed most of the time when
  making normal statements: **I eat**
- **am, is, are, was and were** can be used with
  the _progressive_ (-ing) form of a verb to make the _present progressive_
  and _past progressive_ tenses: **I am eating / was eating**;
  they can also be used with the past participle to form the _passive voice_:
  **I was eaten**

Forms of "to be" can also be used on their own in questions
as the main verb (they're not just helping verbs).

<p class="example"><span class="sPron">What</span> <span class="sVerb">is</span> <span class="sPron">he</span>? 
<span class="sPron">He</span> <span class="sVerb">is</span> <span class="sAdj">a</span> <span class="sNoun">vampire</span>.</p>

<sup>1</sup> Notice, that when you add a form of "do", it functions as a helping verb,
so "likes" becomes "like". When using helping verbs and main verbs together,
only the helping verb shows tense. (The "s" at the end of 3rd person singular
verbs only happens in the present tense.)
