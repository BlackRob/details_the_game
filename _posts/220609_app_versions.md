App versions of details are coming soon! It's just a matter of getting them in the google and iOS stores... there are a lot of steps involved in "publishing" an app to the stores, but the app itself is done.

One of the things the app stores require is a "privacy policy". "details" doesn't have user accounts (for now) or save any data, so privacy is a non-issue for details, but we have to have a page online somewhere saying that, so we put it here: <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>.
